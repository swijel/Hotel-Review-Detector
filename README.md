# Hotel-Review-Detector
Fake Hotel reviews Detector using ML and Sentiment analysis.

In recent years, the World Wide Web has drastically changed the way of sharing opinions. Online reviews are comments, tweets, posts, opinions on different online platforms. Customer analyzes available reviews and makes a decision whether to purchase the product or not. Fake or spam review refers to any unsolicited and irrelevant information about the product or service. Spammer writes fake reviews about the competitorsâ€™ products and promotes their own products.

In order to remove this type of fake reviews and provide the users with the original reviews and rating related to the products, we proposed a Fake Product Review Monitoring and Removal System (FaRMS) which is an Intelligent Interface and takes the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) related to products of Amazon, Flipkart, Yelp and Daraz and analyzes the reviews, and provides the customer with the original rating.

 The target of this task is to foster a mechanized framework fit for recognizing
 counterfeit surveys from a lodging surveys dataset. The framework will use a few AI
 (ML) calculations, including Choice Tree, K-Closest Neighbors (KNN), Strategic
 Relapse, and Backing Vector Machines (SVM), to characterize surveys as either
 certifiable or counterfeit.
